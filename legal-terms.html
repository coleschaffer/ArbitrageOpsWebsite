				<p>You have accepted these Terms of Use, which govern your use of our service. Personally  identifying information is subject to our Privacy Statement, the terms of which are  incorporated herein. Please review our Privacy Statement to understand our practices.</p>

				<p>As used in these Terms of Use, "Arbitrage Ops service", "our service" or "the service" means the  personalized service provided by Arbitrage Ops, including all features and functionalities, early  links, information on retail websites, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software  associated with our service.</p>

				<p>YOU AGREE TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER DESCRIBED IN  SECTION 7 TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WITH Arbitrage Ops (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT  MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="legal-sub-section">
				<h3>Membership.</h3>
				<p>1.1. Your Arbitrage Ops membership will continue month-to-month and automatically renew  until terminated. To use the Arbitrage Ops service you must have Internet access and a  Arbitrage Ops ready device and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. "Payment  Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time  to time and which may include payment through your account with a third party. You must  cancel your membership before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next  month's membership fees to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).</p>

				<p>1.2. We may offer a number of membership plans, including special promotional plans or  memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products  and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third  parties. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be  disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find  specific details regarding your Arbitrage Ops membership by visiting our website and clicking  on the "Account" link.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="legal-sub-section">
				<h3>Free Trials.</h3>
				<p>2.1. Your Arbitrage Ops membership may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your  membership lasts for one month, or as otherwise specified during sign-up and is intended to  allow new and certain former members to try the service.</p>

				<p>2.2. Free trial eligibility is determined by Arbitrage Ops at its sole discretion and we may limit  eligibility or duration to prevent free trial abuse. We reserve the right to revoke the free trial  and put your account on hold in the event that we determine that you are not eligible. We  may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used  with an existing or recent Arbitrage Ops membership to determine eligibility. For  combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.</p>

				<p>2.3. We will charge your Payment Method for your monthly membership fee at the end of the  free trial period and your membership will automatically renew monthly unless you cancel  your membership prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the monthly membership  price and end date of your free trial period, visit our website and click the "Billing details" link  on the "Account" page.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="legal-sub-section">
				<h3>Billing and Cancellation.</h3>
				<p>3.1. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for the Arbitrage Ops service any other charges you may  incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees,  will be charged on a monthly basis to your Payment Method on the calendar day  corresponding to the commencement of the paying portion of your membership until your  membership is cancelled. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. In some cases  your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully  settled or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit our  website at Arbitrage Ops.com/dashboard and review your "Account" page to see your next  payment date. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or  service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to  approximately one month of service as soon as you register. In some instances, your available  balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during your free trial  period.</p>

				<p>3.2. Payment Methods. To use the Arbitrage Ops service you must provide one or more  Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page.  We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment  service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable  Payment Method(s). You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your  account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for  payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a  payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you  do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have  successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may  charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the  processing of your Payment Method. Check with your Payment Method service provider for  details.</p>

				<p>3.3. Cancellation. You can cancel your Arbitrage Ops membership at any time, and you will  continue to have access to the Arbitrage Ops service through the end of your monthly billing  period. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods or  unwatched Arbitrage Ops content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page on our website and  follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will  automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will  close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for Arbitrage Ops using  your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Arbitrage Ops  membership, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your  account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from  the Arbitrage Ops service through that third party. You may also find billing information  about your Arbitrage Ops membership by visiting your account with the applicable third  party.</p>

				<p>3.4. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. We reserve the right to change our  subscription plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner  and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise  expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your  subscription plan will take effect following notice to you.</p>

				<p>3.5. No Refunds. Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially  used periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the  service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may  provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits").  The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and  absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in  the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under  any circumstance.</p>

				<p>6.4. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY  RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="legal-sub-section">
				<h3>Arbitration Agreement.</h3>
	<p>7.1. If you are a Arbitrage Ops member in the United States (including its possessions and  territories), you and Arbitrage Ops agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of  or relating in any way to the Arbitrage Ops service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration  Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is  more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge  or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by  courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award and  nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting any non-waivable  statutory rights. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration  Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Arbitrage  Ops are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This  arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your  Arbitrage Ops membership.</p>

	<p>7.2. If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to  Arbitrage Ops, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to  Arbitrage Ops must be addressed to: General Counsel, Tranton Reselling Services, LLC., 324 S  Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212 ("Notice Address"). If Arbitrage Ops initiates arbitration, it  will send a written Notice to the email address used for your membership account. A Notice,  whether sent by you or by Arbitrage Ops, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim  or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Arbitrage Ops and you do  not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or  Arbitrage Ops may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.</p>

	<p>7.3. If you are required to pay a filing fee for arbitration, after Arbitrage Ops receives notice at  the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Arbitrage Ops will reimburse you  for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which  event you will be responsible for filing fees.</p>

	<p>7.4. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of  the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be  administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by  calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound  by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues  relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless Arbitrage Ops  and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of  your residence. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for  judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of  injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial  review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by  the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law.</p>

	<p>7.5. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the  arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,  through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If  your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a  reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the  award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Arbitrage  Ops's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Arbitrage Ops  did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Arbitrage Ops will pay  you the amount of the award or US$5,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth  herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the  AAA Rules.</p>

	<p>7.6. YOU AND Arbitrage Ops AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER  ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER  IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you  and Arbitrage Ops agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one  person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a  representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then  the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="legal-sub-section">
				<h3>Miscellaneous.</h3>
	<p>9.1. Feedback. Arbitrage Ops is free to use any comments, information, ideas, concepts,  reviews, or techniques or any other material contained in any communication you may send  to us ("Feedback"), including responses to questionnaires/surveys or through postings to the  Arbitrage Ops service, including the Arbitrage Ops website and user interfaces, worldwide  and in perpetuity without further compensation, acknowledgement or payment to you for  any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and  marketing products and creating, modifying or improving the Arbitrage Ops service. In  addition, you agree not to enforce any "moral rights" in and to the Feedback, to the extent  permitted by applicable law.</p>

	<p>9.2. Customer Support. To find more information about our service and its features, or if you  need assistance with your account, please contact a Arbitrage Ops Admin in Billing and  Membership services.</p>

	<p>9.5. Survival. If any provision or provisions of these Terms of Use shall be held to be invalid,  illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions  shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

	<p>9.6. Changes to Terms of Use and Assignment. Arbitrage Ops may, from time to time, change  these Terms of Use. Such revisions shall be effective immediately; provided however, for  existing members, such revisions shall, unless otherwise stated, be effective 30 days after  posting. We may assign our agreement with you to any affiliated company or to any entity  that succeeds to all or substantially all of our business or assets related to the applicable  Arbitrage Ops service.</p>

	<p>9.7. Communication Preferences. We will send you information relating to your account (e.g.  payment authorizations, invoices, changes in password or Payment Method, confirmation  messages, notices) in electronic form only, for example via emails to your email address  provided during registration. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other  communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication  requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p>
